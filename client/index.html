            <div class="item-content">Bibliometric experts use statistical analysis of natural language texts to provide a quantitative view of academic literature. Bibliometric techniques, such as citation analysis, are often used by funding
              agencies to understand and evaluate the publishing results of grant money distribution. While this field of scholarship in general, and citation analysis in particular, have been studied extensively, there still remains a lack of tools
              and techniques for evaluating the surrounding natural language context of individual citations on the network scale. The goal of this project is to aid in the identification of language patterns as they occur across a large corpus of
              academic texts, allow users to create and edit rule sets for evaluation, and then use vector space models to suggest expansions of the user defined natural language rules. Although originally developed for citation analysis, the tool
              can be customized for any number of categories and rules that apply to a given domain problem.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="item-content">The synonymic search project is aimed at humanities researchers trying to ask more intelligent questions of document corpora. Our stakeholders identified to us that as document collections get larger, there is an
              inverse relationship to their ability to find what they are looking for. In the past this has been addressed with novel methods of query generation, but we wanted to offer a different method for building intelligent queries. The
              synonymic search uses a navigable visual thesaurus to allow for query extensions. Users can upload documents, which me model and then direct to similar matches, but can also input keywords and then navigate a hierarchy of English and
              French synonyms that are categorically related. The overall goal of this project was to allow for dynamic query generation especially when the user is not completely certain of what they are searching for. We imagine that through this
              interface humanities researchers can augment their search process to find more relevant results in large document corpora.</div>
